      "Is convalescent plasma the Bruce Leroy we were hoping for? #ICYMI - In a recent article in @nejm, a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial, convalescent plasma with high IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated in patients > 65 years of age with coexisting conditions or > 75 years of age regardless of coexisting condition within 72 hours after the onset of mild COVID-19 symptoms. Coexisting condition was defined as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, chronic renal failure, ‚ù§Ô∏è disease, and COPD. The primary endpoint was the development of severe respiratory disease, defined as a respiratory rate > 30 breaths per minute or more, an O2 sat < 93% on ambient air, or both. ‚Å£\n",

      "Patients were administered 250 mL of convalescent plasma with an IgG titer > 1:1000 against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or 250 mL placebo. Infusions were given over 1.5 - 2 hours. None of the patients received any other experimental therapy for COVID-19. There were 160 patients included in the trial, 80 in the convalescent plasma group and 80 in the placebo group. 16% (13/80) versus 31% (25/80) developed severe respiratory disease in the convalescent plasma and placebo groups, respectively (CI 0.29 - 0.94; p = 0.03). There were no serious adverse effects reported. ‚Å£\n",

      "The authors concluded that administration of high-titer convalescent plasma against SARS-CoV-2 in this older patient population reduced the progression of COVID-19 to severe illness. üîë points about this trial include the age of the participants (> 65 years of age), the time frame of administration of convalescent plasma (within 72 hours of symptoms), and patients that were included only had mild symptoms.

      "One of the most fascinating new areas of raspberry research involves the potential for raspberries to improve management of obesity. Although this research is in its early stages, scientists now know that metabolism in our fat cells can be increased by phytonutrients found in raspberries, especially rheosmin (also called raspberry ketone). By increasing enzyme activity, oxygen consumption, and heat production in certain types of fat cells, raspberry phytonutrients like rheosmin may be able to decrease risk of obesity as well as risk of fatty liver. In addition to these benefits, rheosmin can decrease activity of a fat-digesting enzyme released by our pancreas called pancreatic lipase. This decrease in enzyme activity may result in less digestion and absorption of fat.\n",

      "Are a rich source of many nutritive and non-nutritive bioactive compounds, which are believed to have various health-promoting benefits  and disease preventive effects such as prevention of inflammation disorders and oxidative stress. Strawberries have  also shown to reduce obesity related disorders especially with a nutritional diet. Studies  have shown that strawberries have powerful benefits for a healthy cardiovascular and endocrine systems. They  particularly contain high forms of antioxidants polyphenols, Ellagic acid, flavonoids, phytochemicals and many more‚Ä¶  Including their actions in combating many pathologies. By adding strawberries to your diet it may help to reduce oxidative damage as well as blood lipids. The NrF2 protein production found in strawberries helps reduce cholesterol in the  blood. They have shown to be of beneficial value  for  prediabetics. Potassium and manganese strengthen the cardiovascular system and may have an impact on lowering hypertension. Strawberries also contain Fisetin, which is polyphenol a flavonoid (family flavanol). Fisetin stimulates brain functions. As they are packed with vitamin C  and manganese. Research has shown by consuming small portions of  strawberries every day for 8 weeks may  improve short term memory loss, which may have positive effects with Alzheimer's deseas. They contain  decent amounts of folate (vitamin B9)  and fiber. Great for digestion and bowel movement. Strawberries contain anti-aging properties called anthocyanin, also helps protect against skin damage, lowering levels of inflammation. Due to their wonderful ability to fight free radical damage. Using the flesh of the fruit for a face mask can refresh and nourish the skin. Strawberries are a good source of a diuretic which helps to remove excess amount of fluid from the body  therefore encouraging kidney health. Strawberries hold Dopamine (happy hormone production) which stimulates your brain. ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "~ GUT TYPE 1: BACTEROIDES ~\n",
      "\n",
      "So continuing on from yesterday‚Äôs post, today I wanted to focus on Bacteroides. ~\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems like out of the 3 families of gut bacteria, Bacteroides are the most researched. This makes sense as they often form the dominant population in our guts! ~\n",
      "\n",
      "They are able to make any enzymes needed to break down carbohydrates, so whether we munch on a huge burger or a little salad, they will know what to do! ~\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the research into Bacteroides has been linked to energy and weight. And this is because Bacteroides have the ability to extract the maximum energy from food consumed, therefore implying a link with potential weight gain. ~\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, Bacteroides appear to be more common in the guts of individuals who eat meat. But the cause and effect of this relationship is unknown - does having them in our gut make us more prone to being overweight? Or does being overweight lead to having more of them in our guts? ~\n",
      "\n",
      "Another link that has been found is with the production of vitamin H. This is quite a complex link but in summary, vitamin H is necessary for healthy skin, nails and hair, and research suspects that Bacteroides produces it! This is because studies have found that some people excrete more of it than they take in, therefore implying that vitamin H must be produced in the body. ~\n",
      "\n",
      "There are so many studies out there but another one that I wanted to give a quick mention to was one published in 2016. This study found lower levels of Bacteroides in the Gut to be associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). ~\n",
      "\n",
      "So again, it seems like there are a lot of future practical applications that can be taken from this research. But as the research is still in its infancy, we‚Äôll have to wait and see. But maybe by studying this further we may find new ways to help IBD, to reduce vitamin H deficiencies and even potentially reduce obesity rates (but obviously this has serious ethical considerations). ~\n",

This is more microorganisms than the number of genes in our body, technically making us more bacteria than human!\n",

      "üíäüç∑ Our gut bacterial community is constantly changing due to many factors such as dietary intake, alcohol consumption, antibiotic use and stress. In recent years, there has been a decline in the number and diversity of bacteria found in our guts, which may have a negative effect on many aspects of our health, one being our weight. ü§∏üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Obesity results from a prolonged imbalance between energy intake and expenditure caused by a complex interplay between genetic susceptibility and nutritional, physiological, social, and environmental factors. Recent research has identified that the gut microbiome may also play a role.\n",

      "The human gut is mostly dominated by two bacterial phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. In normal, healthy circumstances, there is a healthy balance between these two phyla in the gut.

Something that‚Äôs worth your time (and doesn‚Äôt take much time anyway): keeping a food journal. New research published in the journal Obesity found the tried-and-true practice of logging what you eat is key to losing weight. In the study, people who recorded calories, fat and portion sizes were more apt to be successful in their weight-loss goals than those who didn‚Äôt maintain diet diaries. The biggest finding: The effort took less than 15 minutes per day.\n",

      "Today we live in a technological advanced world which has resulted in a boom of fitness related technology. Everyone can now track their calories, monitor their daily steps and subscribe to fitness apps. .\n",
      ".\n",
      "Despite this boom in available data, we still have a major obesity problem. The issue is multifaceted but one of the main problems stems from our inability to properly assess the data presented to us. .\n",
      ".\n",
      "Collecting data is useless if it doesn‚Äôt impact your decisions and behaviours. You must analyse your data and and make changes where required. .\n",
      ".\n",
      "For instance, if your goal is fat loss, what‚Äôs the point in tracking your calories in My Fitness Pal if you don‚Äôt make any changes? Why weigh yourself daily and watch the scale continually climb but not do anything about it? Here you are collecting data and not reacting, yet expecting change. .\n",
      ".\n",
      "Additionally, it‚Äôs important to note that technology is limited and rarely does anything exist in isolation. Likewise, there is a big difference between theory and reality. In theory, creating a calorie deficit is easy and leads to fat loss. The reality is everyone needs different protocols and adapts at different rates. Plus there are numerous physiological and psychological factors that need to be considered. .\n",

      "While I am technically a Personal Trainer, the reality is I don‚Äôt personally train people anymore. I am now more a Data Analyst and Strategist who specialises in training and nutritional periodisation. By obtaining and analysing client data, I can manipulate energy balance from afar. .\n",
      ".\n",
      "I no longer need a physical location to positively change someone‚Äôs physique and health. Instead you can find me working in random cafes, Beats headphones üéß on and deep in data analysis. We all can change, you just have to know what to assess and how to react accordingly.\n",
