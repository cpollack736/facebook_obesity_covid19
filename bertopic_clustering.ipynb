It contains high levels sugar and it would never even cross your mind that it could lead to increased risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and even tooth decay.

Soda ￼ Carbonated drinks are your worst enemies in regard to your health and well being. It can damage your skin, alter your blood sugar levels, impaire your hormones and mood. Don't mind the marketing tricks and the labels that say it’s good for you or it contains nutrients that is good for your body.

Sugar ￼ Sugar is quite addictive and it spikes your glucose levels and increases your bad fat, it can lead to heart disease. Stay away from sugar and reduce the risk of diabetes, cancer, obesity, heart disease, and much more.

A half-pound weight loss is still trending in the right direction, but I was a little disappointed that I didn’t lose more. I tried to wink at Mom to make the scale lower, but she said that is not how things work. 🙅‍♀️ However, Mom said she is very proud of me. I was pretty sick recently so I had to rest. Plus, for several days Phoenix 🌵 🌞 was under a heat advisory (it was 110 degrees Fahrenheit) so I was not exercising. I get the occasional treat to keep me motivated, but I’ve been very good at sticking to my 600 calorie a day diet. I need to remain focused on my journey from “obese to beast” and I’m going to work hard this weekend so that my “weekend does not become my week’s end.” 🦄🦄\n",

      "Today's \"Transformation Tuesday\" story is from Johnson City location Lifestyle Fitness Member Laura Prime Jones. Laura is a long time Member here at Lifestyle Fitness and wanted to share her story so that it will inspire others. Read Laura's awesome and unique story below: \"I want to start my story by mentioning two ladies who changed my life back in 2011, Certified Instructors Dessi Foster and Sandra Talford. I started at Lifestyle Fitness with a bunch of weight to lose. These two ladies had me dancing it away! After repeated years of medical problems I had to drop out of the gym. I gained all of the weight I had lost plus more. After the weight gain and my many medical issues, I got serious and started my weight loss journey again. My doctors advised me that weight loss surgery was my best option to battle this life long battle with obesity. They informed me that this isn’t a fix just a tool to help people who’s bodies are built to store weight such as mine and for people who have tried everything conventional but are at their wits end. I had the surgery May 1st, 2017. This takes alot of dedication and discipline. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a quick fix and not the end of your Journey. You have to be willing to stay on a strict eating plan and you have to exercise. The Doctors asked me are you ready for this? Of course my first thoughts were of Dessi and Sandra, these ladies are so amazing!! I have lost 120 lbs and gone from a size 26 to a 14! I am toning up and losing weight dancing with these ladies in their WERQ and Club Zumba classes and I love it! Fitness is not a \"One Size Fits All' situation. You have to find what works for you, and for me, this was the Journey I chose. I say, find your Journey, you will know when it is the right Path. Lastly, I want to say \"Thank you guys\" for not only being amazing instructors but for being inspiring everyday!!\"\n",

I’m sitting at 18.4 % body fat which is lean (.4 % from ultra lean) is a good place to be right now. Bulking season is a mental game and it’s hard watching the scale go up but we do it to come back bigger and better.

      "Not getting enough sleep skews our ability to regulate our emotions. In the long run, this can increase our risk of developing a mental health condition. In turn, conditions such as anxiety and depression may cause further sleep disruption. A lack of good quality sleep can negatively affect mental health. Fortunately, there are proven ways to improve sleep quality and break out of this vicious cycle. In this Special Feature, we discuss sleep and its deep relationship with mental health. More than 400 years ago, William Shakespeare described the gift of sleep and the distress of insomnia: O sleep! O gentle sleep! Nature’s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee, That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down And steep my senses in forgetfulness? – Henry IV, Part 2 Shakespeare’s description of sleep as “nature’s soft nurse” was closer to the truth than he could have known. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), insufficient sleep increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Sleep is essential for the physical upkeep of the body, but it also helps maintain cognitive skills, such as attention, learning, memory, and emotional regulation. Getting a good night’s rest even underpins our ability to perceive the world accurately. Research suggests that going completely without sleep for 3 or more nights in a row results in perceptual distortions, hallucinations, and delusions. The latest discoveries about the importance of sleep for physical and mental well-being come at a time when technology is putting pressure on sleep time as never before. Social media, the internet, TV on demand, and video games are increasingly keeping us from our beds in the evenings. The CDC advise that adults get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep a day, with the specific recommendation varying by age. However, according to the 2012 National Health Interview Survey, almost one-third (29%) of adults in the United States sleep for less than 6 hours each night. Two-way link to mental health Poor sleep is a recognized risk factor for the development of a range of mental health issues. A study that followed 979 young adults in Michigan, for example, found that insomnia was associated with a four-fold higher risk of depression 3 years later. A review of research found evidence that insomnia preceded the development of not only depression but also bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders. The researchers also found a link between insomnia and an increased risk of suicide. In 2020, a study published in JAMA Psychiatry identified an association between sleep problems in early childhood and the development of psychosis and borderline personality disorder in adolescence. As well as increasing the risk of developing mental health problems, sleep disturbances are also a common feature of most mental illnesses, including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Prof. Daniel Freeman, a psychiatrist, and his colleagues at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom believe that the two-way relationship between sleep problems and poor mental health can result in a downward spiral. Writing in The Lancet Psychiatry, they say that doctors can be slow to address these issues in people with mental health problems: “The traditional view is that disrupted sleep is a symptom, consequence, or nonspecific epiphenomenon of [mental ill health]; the clinical result is that the treatment of sleep problems is given a low priority. An alternative perspective is that disturbed sleep is a contributory causal factor in the occurrence of many mental health disorders. An escalating cycle then emerges between the distress of the mental health symptoms, effect on daytime functioning, and struggles in gaining restorative sleep.” A form of cognitive behavioral therapy for treating insomnia (CBT-I) has proven its worth as a way to tackle this cycle of sleep problems and mental health conditions. When Prof. Freeman and his colleagues randomly assigned 3,755 students with insomnia from 26 universities in the U.K. to receive either CBT-I or usual care, they found that the treatment was associated with significant improvements. Students who received CBT-I not only slept better, but they also experienced less paranoia and had fewer hallucinations. According to a 2015 meta-analysis, CBT-I may also be an effective treatment for anxiety and depression in people with insomnia. How does CBT for insomnia work? The treatment involves educating people about sleep and aims to change their sleep-related behaviors and thought processes. People learn about good sleep hygiene, which involves practices such as limiting daytime naps, avoiding alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine in the evening, and refraining from using digital devices at bedtime. The behavioral techniques include: Sleep restriction: Reducing the time the person spends in bed to match more closely the amount of sleep they need. Stimulus control: For example, (truncated)\n",

      "New Times (Rwanda) Reasons for getting a good night’s rest: Sleep specialists encourage getting at least seven hours of sleep each night. Medics explain that a single night of poor sleep can leave one feeling lazy and too tired to work efficiently, exercise, or eat healthfully. And over time, continued sleep deprivation raises the risk of a number of chronic health problems, including obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Insufficient sleep can also leave a person more vulnerable to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. Lack of sleep can reduce memory and learning ability. Researchers have found that just five hours of lost sleep in a 24-hour period can cut off the connection between neurons in the hippocampus, the area of the brain associated with memory. The World Health Organization (WHO) research on cardiovascular disease, explains that poor sleep and sleep disorders interfere with heart health, increasing one’s risk of heart attack and stroke. “During the last few decades, many studies have reported a strong association between sleep duration and mortality risk. These findings have shown that individuals sleeping between seven to nine hours at night, experience the lowest risks for all-cause mortality when compared to those who sleep for shorter or longer periods,” states Sleep Science, an official journal of the Brazilian Sleep Society. Sleep Science also adds that even though the lack of sleep is thought of as an individual or a personal issue, insufficient sleep can have much wider adverse social and economic effects. Due to its potential negative impact on higher functions, such as judgment, decision-making, and reaction time, sleep deprivation can increase the risk of fatal accidents and injury. According to Harvard Health Publishing, in rare cases, insufficient sleep can even be more dangerous. A sleep shortfall can lead to daytime drowsiness and “micro sleeps.” Micro sleeps are brief bouts of sleep that occur during the day that usually last just a few seconds. If you have ever briefly nodded off while sitting through a lecture or work, you have experienced micro sleep. They usually last just a few seconds but can go on for 10 or 15 seconds—and pose a serious danger if they happen while someone is driving as it can lead to motor accidents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), explains that children and adolescents who do not get enough sleep have a higher risk of many health problems, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, poor mental health, and injuries. They are also more likely to have attention and behaviour problems, which can contribute to poor academic performance in school. CDC urges students to have the proper amount of sleep at night to help stay focused, improve concentration, and academic performance. “Getting enough sleep is important, but good sleep quality is also essential. Signs of poor sleep quality include feeling sleepy or tired even after getting enough sleep, repeatedly waking up during the night, and having symptoms of a sleep disorder (such as snoring or gasping for air). Better sleep habits may improve the quality of your sleep,” states CDC. Causes of insufficient sleep In 2006, the Institute of Medicine report emphasised insufficient sleep is more common in individuals who do the night shift work or who work more than 40 hours per week. This tendency is slightly greater among females. Patients often report daytime sleepiness that impedes their activities and functioning. While work schedules are an important environmental contributor to reduced duration of sleep, the demands of work do not have the same effect on all individuals. Dr Kenneth Ruzindana, a consultant at Kigali University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (CHUK), notes that lack of enough sleep can be due to insomnia. Insomnia is defined as trouble falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or waking up early in the morning and not being able to return to sleep. He carries on that people with insomnia sleep less or poorly, regardless of having a suitable chance to sleep. The poor sleep may lead to distress functioning during the daytime. Insomnia symptoms have been linked with an increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Some studies have suggested that the association is primarily mediated by underlying depression. Insomnia is also allied with sympathetic nervous system activation, and a number of studies have shown an association between insomnia and elevated cardiovascular risk, including hypertension and myocardial infarction, Ruzindana adds. Health experts recommend the following hours for sleep depending on one’s age. Infants (4 to 12 months) require 12 to 16 hours per 24 hours (including naps), toddlers (1 to 2 years) need 11 to 14 hours per 24 hours (including naps). Yet pre-schoolers (3 to 5 years) need 10 to 13 hours per 24 hours (including naps). For school age (6 to 12 years) require 9 to 12 hours per 24 (truncated)\n",
