Bariatric surgery has demonstrated dramatic improvement of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and reduction of overall mortality. The anti-diabetes effect of certain bariatric procedures, particularly gastric bypass surgery, results from mechanisms that go beyond weight loss alone. Surgical treatment of type 2 diabetes may be offered to less obese patients with excellent results. If you have chronic diabetes that is preventing you from living your life to the fullest come and consult our bariatric surgeons and allow them to customize your treatment plan. #diabetes #IHD #iranianhospitaldubai #Surgery #Hospital #Dubai #Services #dubaidoctors #hypertension #treatment #CyberCityServices #cholesterol #triglycerides #Bariatricsurgery #weightloss\n",

In fact, a recent survey from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) has found that 85 percent of adults in the United States get less than seven hours of sleep a night. Sleep deprivation has previously been shown to increase the risk of several health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity.... https://www.joshwho.net/sleeping-goals-to-achieve-adequate-sleep/\n",

      "Ladies, Here's how to maximise your sleep to also maximise your fat loss! 😴 Lack of sleep may be to blame for your larger-than-normal appetite, according to science... 💤 A 2012 study published in the International Journal of Obesity found that 6-8 hours of sleep time predicted weight loss success (among other things like less stress.) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21448129 A 2015 meta analysis published in the Obesity Review suggested that sleep restriction may increase total food intake. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4532553/ A more recent study found significant impact on body composition when sleep was reduced (more lean muscle lost and less fat lost) and even suggested that making up for lost sleep on the weekend doesn't help to counteract these body composition effects! https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29438540 These findings may be partly due to changes in appetite regulating hormones leptin (may increase with sleep deprivation leading to increased hunger) and ghrelin (may decrease with sleep deprivation leading to increased hunger.) What do you think, are you more hungry when you're even just a little sleep-deprived? P.S. I help women lose weight by changing their habits and sleep is just one of the habits I look at with my clients who are trying to lose 30lbs or more.

      "Tonight on my personal FB page I posted a picture of my dogs dinner. It wasn't until a FB friend commented that the \"diced beef and mixed beef with veg and blueberries in a beetroot/cottage cheese puree and coconut/pumpkin mash\" must of been my dinner as they didn't think dogs could eat those foods, that I thought it a good time to share an oldie but a goodie post I once wrote. How many other dog parents go to a similar extent with their fur-kids dinner? FROM GOOD DOG PARENT TO GREAT DOG PARENT... Foods which may increase your dogs health, life-span, reduce health conditions and improve their quality of life! Cranberries This superfood is very rich in antioxidants and very low in calories. Antioxidants make cells regenerate faster by protecting them from harmful free radicals.They also contain plenty of vitamins such as vitamin C, A and K. These vitamins strengthen a dog’s heart health and support his bone strength. But these aren’t the only ways cranberries can enrich your dog’s nutrition. This superfood is also very known as an effective cure for UTIs. So if your dog starts to pee a lot thanks to a urinary infection, you know what to do. Blueberries Bluberries are rich in fiber and antioxidants and contain vitamins C and K.They help in preventing colon cancer, heart diseases, and obesity.

      "Death by Covid. Are the CDC numbers reliable or presented accurately for public understanding? From the CDC out of CDC published reports . . . August 2020 the CDC stated 94% of 180,000 deaths that have been attributed to COVID-19, “on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per individual death.” As the CDC report notes the only 6% of all deaths were Covid only deaths. In other words, 94 percent of Americans who have died from coronavirus from February 2020 through August 2020 had, on average, almost three comorbidities that played a role in their death besides Covid. According to CDC’s report, the leading comorbidities among these deaths in highest first order were respiratory diseases, circulatory diseases, sepsis, malignant neoplasms, diabetes, obesity and Alzheimer’s disease. A plethora of polls show that most Americans do not trust the federal government, state government or the local governments pertaining to all things related to coronavirus. Two resources below.

      "\"In 1995, I weighed 260 pounds. I’d been overweight or obese all my life. My blood pressure was high and I was borderline diabetic. Cheese, ice cream and Coke were staples in my diet. Our daughter-in-law somehow convinced me to try the McDougall plan for six weeks. During those weeks I felt better and I lost weight. However, since I was in diet mentality, once those six weeks were up it was right back to hot fudge marshmallow malts, cheeseburgers and fries, and I regained all the weight back that I lost and more. Even though I slipped back into bad habits after my first round on the McDougall Plan, the sound practices he espouses eventually worked their way into my awareness and became the foundation for the way I have eaten ever since. During the next year, sticking to the McDougall Plan, I let go of 120 pounds and I’ve kept it off. Along with all of this, I got off the couch and completed five marathons. Today I’m an avid long-distance road cyclist, and I love backpacking in the mountains. Over the past 23 years as a Medical Hypnotherapist, I’ve helped many people end their desires for foods that make them fat and sick and create healthy desires for the McDougall Plan foods that make them slender and thin... These stories feed my passion. I love to be in my office or live online with people from around the world sharing with them about the Starch Solution, so they too can improve their health and change their life.\" - Roger, 2020\n",

      "September: 30 Days Of Hope Today I am celebrating Jennifer. Here's her story: \"Most of my life I have been told repeatedly how tall and skinny I was by family, friends, and total strangers. I’m not sure I liked hearing it, but I was glad to be tall (I’m 5’10”) and not unhappy to be thin. My older sister warned me that when I got to be 40-something, things would probably change. Even at my heaviest (178, which I didn’t realize at the time earned me an ‘obese’ notation in my medical chart), people still commented on how tall and thin I was. I didn’t look bad, but the skin around my knees jiggled when I ran (which wasn’t often) and the skin on my midriff jiggled when I brushed my teeth. That got my attention. I am a junk food- aholic and I cut back. I lost about 10 pounds and maintained that for several years. My husband started program last year and lost 30 pounds. I told myself I knew what was healthy to eat and I could lose weight (if I wanted to) myself. That didn’t work. I toyed with the idea for several months before I decided to take the plunge in April 2020. I brought my husband back on program with me as he’d picked back up some of his weight after starting a very demanding doctoral program. I am not a morning person so breakfast has never been my thing. Therefore, I have a Velvety Hot Chocolate EVERY morning while enjoying time on the porch while my dog has his breakfast. We travel quite a bit and it’s very easy to pack up our fuelings and go. I’ve always maintained weight loss while on the road. I weighed 143 pounds at a doctor’s appointment on September 1, down 25 pounds, and am now on the healthy side of the BMI scale for my height. My husband, also down 25 pounds, just ordered some 34-inch waist pants. I better understand why I eat and how to eat and have made sleeping 8 hours/night a priority.\" #healthcoach #lifelongtransformation\n",

      "Warning: this is long and please delete if not allowed. I’m 62 years old. I am morbidly obese...252# on my 5’2” frame. Last year I lost from 267# down to 230#. I lost the weight on a low carb low fat diet fairly easily without much exercise. I can’t really exercise because of an autoimmune disorder in my back. I lost the weight to get my knees replaced but when I went to the doctor in February, he told me I had to lose 30# more. And then the pandemic hit. My husband and I are both in a high risk group so we have been quarantining since early March. I didn’t get to be this age and morbidly obese without having a malfunctioning response to stress. In other words...I stress eat big time AND I have gained back 20 pounds. My brain keeps telling me “what’s the use in trying” but my heart wants my active life back. I want to be able to walk. So I’m asking you folks who I have been watching for a year...how can an anxious, sedentary old woman lose weight and keep it off? I didn’t mention that I tried for 14 months to lose weight and 37# was all I could lose and yes I tried very strict keto and it did not work. Is there someone out there who is my age with my restrictions who lost weight and kept it off and how the heck did you so it?\n",
