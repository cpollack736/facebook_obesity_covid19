      "A ketogenic diet provides many benefits for health. Early research suggests that a very low carb ketogenic diet may help fight cancer. Here's what to know.\n",
      "-----\n",
      "Trying to figure out this keto lifestyle? The new year and you're trying to commit to a \"new you\"? Don't be too harsh on the old you. Old you got you were you are so far. Old you stuggles with the things you want to change right now. Whether that is weight loss or managing blood sugar, healing insuiln resistance, or managing other health issues. Keto can be an awesome solution. IF you can do it. Consistently. All day. Every day. Keto is so different from all other \"diets\". I'm not gonna tell you it's not a diet. I'm not gonna be cliche and say \"it's a lifestyle!\" Even I groan when I hear that now, but keto is a mindset. Keto, done well, changes the way we think about food. Before keto, food controlled me. I woke hungry and spent the day thinking about what I was going to eat. Food entertained me. It sustained me. Food was the answer to hypoglycemia and what seemed like uncontrolled hunger. Even after a meal in which I was 'stuffed', I found myself hungry a few hours later. It was that HUNGER, unsatisfied, that left me obese. Hunger is a powerful motivator. How could I have been obese, with seemingly ample stored energy (fat), but always been hungry? That's the secret to the diet universe y'all!! Solve the hunger problem. How do we do that? Well...for me, keto solved the hunger problem by keeping blood sugar stable and letting my insulin fall to normal levels. See, high insulin and unstable blood glucose drives hunger becomes of hormones. Eat carbs, blood sugar rises. The body can only handle 4 teaspoons of sugar at a time. Body yells, \"Help! We got sugar!\" Body sends insulin to address the sugar. What does insulin do? Insulin turns sugar (glucose, carbs, starches--a rose by any other name) into fat. That's its first super power. Then, insulin stores the fat. into our cells. locks it up. Insulin is a hoarder hormone. It keeps the fat locked in the cells. See, glucose can burn quickly. Fat burning, lipolysis, is a lower, steady flame. It actually isn't as easy for the body to burn fat, which is why it takes time to switch from primarily burning glucose (carbs) to burning fat. When your body is deprived of sugar, starches--CARBS!--then it must turn to fat as it's fuel source. Thankfully, when blood glucose falls or become stable, there should be less insulin and the stored fat can be used. FINALLY! One of the reasons why you aren't hungry on a strict keto diet is because you are finally able to use stored body fat. It's a fascinating experience. Now...here's the thing. It only works IF you stay consistent. Even one little Hershey kiss can throw your body off. The body MUST address whatever sugar you give it. How? As I explained above, blood glucose up, insulin to the rescue, sugar stored as fat, hunger levels UP! That's a simplified version, but I need you to understand why every meal matters. Every snack, every flavored beverage, every food, every bite, ESPECIALLY if you are obese, diabetic, and/or insulin resistance. This is why two servings of cauliflower can actually be harmful to some people. We all have different levels of carb tolerance. So many points to make here. I don't want the message to be lost. If you're new, keep carbs low to keep blood sugar stable. Many of us have to eat fewer than 7 carbs per meal. Next, be consistent. Even if only for two solid weeks, be vigilant about sugar and carbs so that your body can get rid of the cravings and begin to have stable blood glucose and begin to lower insulin levels. Understand that eating even one meal off plan sends the blood sugar up, the insulin out, and can bring the hunger and cravings back in full force. That's one reason why we see people start, stumble, start, stumble, start. Or worse, they claim \"didn't work for me!\". Well, it can't work if you can't be consistent. Wait for the hunger. Listen for it. Forget the ketone test strips--don't waste your money. Be vigilant about low carbs, enjoy fatty meals, and in between listen for the hunger. If you're not hungry, you're doing it all right! You're on the downhill slide! #makeprogress #hunger #gettingstarted #downhillslide\n",

      "Covi-19 asymptomatic super-spreaders, pandemic growth probabilities, mobility, connectivity of interactions, global travel, Green Zone and Red Zone strategies, long haulers post treatment chronic health issues all discussed here in this excellent piece. Highlighting this excerpt about the 'long haulers': >>>{How to gauge the danger posed by a COVID-19 surge? Schneider bids we remember the hospital and death rates that overwhelmed Spain, New York City and northern Italy during the first wave. The first danger is obvious: about 30 to 40 per cent of the total population are at risk for serious complications from COVID-19 due to a variety of health issues ranging from obesity to age, noted Schneider. Then come the not so obvious long-term risks of infection: pulmonary fibrosis, blood clots, heart inflammation, renal impairment, brain damage, chronic fatigue. In the northern Italian city of Bergamo, where 6,000 people died in the first wave, researchers are now doing a long-term study on the survivors. Their findings underscore Schneider’s comments. The first group of 750 people examined reported that they hadn’t recovered from their infection even though six months had passed. Thirty per cent had lung scarring or breathing issues while another 30 per cent had blood clotting problems or heart inflammation. Others complained of fatigue, leg pains and hair loss.}<<< QUOTE Andrew Nikiforuk: Switch to a ‘Green Zone’ Strategy for Taming COVID-19. Two physicists believe Canada should aim for zero cases, and lay out how. For nine months now COVID-19 has unsettled Canada and most of the world. Millions have suffered from the disease and economies have been upended. Yet no concerted action has been taken in Canada. It’s largely been every province for itself. “What would it look like if a leader stood up and said, ‘Let’s make an effort together to eliminate this disease’?” That’s the question two MIT-trained physicists, Yaneer Bar-Yam and Matthias Schneider, are now asking political leaders. Unlike most politicians these physicists understand pandemics are complex events that require direct, rapid and multi-layered responses. They also join other experts in arguing that achieving near zero transmission is possible. And much better than living through cycles of exponential growth, lockdowns and renewed waves — Canada’s current predicament. Or as Yaneer Bar-Yam puts it: “Do it right or keep doing it over.” +++ Eliminating super-spreaders >>> Schneider began with this truth: “One thing is crystal clear: If you want to stop a fire you do it when it is small, not when the whole city is in flames. You don’t need a PhD in physics, medicine or economics to understand that.” His presentation then explained the mechanisms, from power laws to exponential growth, that drive pandemics. Schneider noted that pandemics are extreme yet highly-probable events with long consequences. Extreme numbers tend to drive these extreme events. For example about 10 per cent of the population, the so-called super-spreaders, now account for 80 per cent of all infections. Most of these super-spreaders of course, are asymptomatic, and don’t know they are infected. “Extreme outliers drive the pandemic; not the mass of people,” explained Schneider. The biggest recorded super-spreader event to date occurred at a soccer game in Milan. That biological bomb infected 7,000 people. But super-spreader events happen every day at pubs, weddings, churches, schools and gyms when super-spreaders breathe, laugh, sing and spit out the virus via droplets and tinier aerosols. An aerosol is a particle or droplet, about the width of one hair, suspended in the air. These infectious particles can travel much further than six feet (eight metres in one meat plant, research has found). They can also remain suspended in the air for hours. Just one super-spreader in a pub can launch from 10 to 100,000 aerosols in the air. You only need to inhale about 100 particles to become infected. That’s why wearing masks is so easy yet so effective. It filters the air both ways. Schneider didn’t mention it but the science on masks is punishing. U.S jurisdictions such as North and South Dakota, which patently ignored the importance of masks, have suffered horribly in the second wave because they gave super-spreaders a grand advantage. Schneider said it is almost impossible to predict which people will be super-spreaders, “but we can eliminate super-spreaders by eliminating infections.” When authorities eliminate infections in a jurisdiction, the community can put a lid on supers-spreading events. But when authorities such as many of Canada’s premiers choose to allow those infections to grow, they act like arsonists in their own homes and feed exponential growth. +++ The power and damage of infectious surges >>> Schneider then compared a viral outbreak to a block of ice encountering warm temperatures. The warmer it gets, the more (truncated)\n",

      "Ugh! Went to my in-laws for a week to celebrate my hubby’s birthday and gained nearly 5 lbs. 😢😢😢 Not their fault. I had healthy options. Even took some snacks and my food scale. But totally gave in and stopped even logging points after day one. 😢😢😢 I was finally under 190 and now I’m back in the 190s. I know I just need to get back on track (which I did immediately yesterday) but I’m so frustrated with myself. I was feeling so good about my progress (23lbs down in 2 1/2 months). Now I feel fat and frustrated. It’s amazing what 5 lbs can do to your self esteem! Even at my lowest weight, I was still obese. But I was feeling so confident. This morning I got up and weighed and I’d lost .4 lbs. That was after eating healthy and tracking yesterday, drinking 80 oz of water, and working out for 93 minutes yesterday. I know .4 is a good amount to lose in one day, but even if I continue losing at that rate, it will take me another 9-10 days JUST to get back to where I was on March 18th. 😢 Why did I do it, y’all!?! I know getting back on track right now is gonna help. But what are some things you do to help yourself mentally, encourage yourself, motivate yourself, etc when you fall off the wagon? ❤️\n",

      "We'd love to introduce you to our second Community Moderator for the next few months here in Bright Line Eating Official! Sandy Weiss Sharpe has extensive BLE knowledge and experience and has been living at maintenance for quite sometime now! We are excited to have her here to support and inspire all of us! Let's get to know Sandy better! <3 ____________________________ \"The picture on the left was taken on my 50th birthday. The one on the right was taken a couple of months ago. I’m about to turn 54 in a couple of weeks. To be honest, I felt ok when I turned 50. I also thought this was the best I could do. I had lost 60 pounds with a costly program that had me eating 700 calories a day, taking appetite suppressants (😡), getting vitamin b shots weekly and eating processed bars to help with hunger. However, it didn’t last and eventually I put 30 pounds back on, started seeing a nutritionist who taught me some things but it wasn’t until 8 months later that I found BLE. That was October, 2016. I’ve lost track of days. There is no more what the hell effect for me. No more all or nothing. What I’ve learned since that picture on the left was taken was that I wasn’t ok. I was obese. I was addicted. I wasn’t healthy. I, for sure, wasn’t free. So much more was possible and I was capable of the thing that eluded me my whole life. I could be that person I’ve always wanted to be. If I only knew then what I know now. I am grateful beyond words that I now know I am capable. I am worthy. I can do it.\"\n",

      "This is my story.. Dale's Story.... I was tired of failing and yo yo dieting. I was hurting from all the snide comments and embarrassed by the way I looked. I was sick of always being exhausted and not being able to live the life I deserved. I heard what some were saying. They said it wouldn't last, I couldn't do it, and if I could, I wouldn't be able to keep it off, just like all the times before; with all the other \"diets\". Honestly I had given up hope. Then I found this program and proved them all wrong. It took me about 9 months to lose 97 lbs. I am now living my new healthy lifestyle, the life I deserve. Now 3.5 years later and I am in better shape than I was 26 years ago (which by the way is 1/2 my age). If I can do this ANYBODY can do this!! This is Katie's Story... Wow! On January 5th 2014, I collapsed at church and passed out 3 times before rescue arrived. Not only was I hospitalized for 1 1/2 months and then went to a rehabilitation center for another month but I also lost the ability to walk for over 8 months. It took 2 years before my doctors could figure out what was wrong with me. I was diagnosed with NCS (Neurocardiogenic Syncope). NCS is a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure leading to fainting, often in reaction to a stressful trigger. I was also diagnosed with Conversion Disorder which is a mental condition in which a person has blindness, paralysis, or other nervous system (neurologic) symptoms that cannot be explained with a medical evaluation. Both conditions are caused by stress. The combination of both of these conditions along with being obese causes me to pass out dozens of times a day. I had to relearn how to walk and how to be aware of triggers that causes my stress. Simply lifting my arms over my head for just for a couple of seconds would cause me to pass out. I had to have 24/7 care and could not be left alone. I have to say without my husband, all my doctors, my family, my friends & my church family helping me, I would still be in that wheel chair. My husband & I were introduced to a program that helped me lose 77 pounds. I also met with the Co-founder of the company Dr. Wayne Andersen. He asked me what my diagnosis was and I explained it to him. He assured me that by losing the excess weight it would help the conditions and would most likely decrease my episodes or they may even go away. As I write this post in January 2019 I am happy to say he was right. Although I still suffer from some of these symptoms, my quality of life has vastly improved.
