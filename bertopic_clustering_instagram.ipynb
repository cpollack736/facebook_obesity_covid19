      "1. A good night’s sleep puts people in a better mood. The more tired you are the less patience you have, the more likely you are to snap at a loved one a colleague.\n",
      "2. A good night’s sleep helps reduce stress. When your body is sleep deficient, it can go into a state of stress. The body's functions are put on high alert, which causes high blood pressure and the production of stress hormones. High blood pressure increases your risk of heart attack and stroke. \n",
      "3. Research has proven that sleep plays a very important role in the process called memory consolidation. Your body may be resting but your brain is busy processing the day’s events. It makes connections between events, sensory input, feelings and memories. The better the night’s sleep the better you will retain information.\n",
      "4. People who sleep less regularly are more likely to be overweight and obese. Research has shown that lack of sleep impacts the balance of hormones in the body that affects appetite.\n",
      "5. Consistently getting a good night sleep has shown to improve athletic performance. A study of basketball players has proven that longer sleep significantly improved speed, accuracy, reaction times as well as mental wellbeing.\n",
      "6. In a study on healthy young men, restricting sleep to four hours per night for six nights in a row caused symptoms of prediabetes. These symptoms reduced after one week of increased sleep. Poor sleep habits are also strongly linked to adverse effects on blood sugar in the general population. Those sleeping less than six hours per night have repeatedly been shown to be at an increased risk of type 2 diabetes\n",
      "7. More energy. There is no denying that after a great night’s sleep we wake feeling more energized and ready to go.\n",
      "8. A great night’s sleep can make you fell more attractive. Sleep is excellent for the skin and it shouldn’t be an overlooked as a fundamental part of the beauty regime.\n",
      "9. A bad night’s sleep slows reaction time and your ability to focus.\n",

      "Comment your maintenance calories below! By @smurray_32 ➖\n",
      "So, there are 5 factors influencing fat gain from overfeeding 1) Maintenance calories, people with lower maintenances will obviously end up in a bigger surplus & gain more, 2) Body fat, lean individuals have less adipocytes & thus less capacity to store triglycerides vs obese who can have 4x more 3) Lvl. of glycogen depletion, the more depleted, the more carbs will go to glycogen thus less fat gain 4) Macro composition, carbs are less likely than fats 10% vs 50% of excess calories shown by Horton et al (1995) 5) Increasing NEAT, some can increase NEAT x10 from acute overfeeding (Lavine et al 1999), some can decrease it\n",
      "➖\n",
      "I need to firstly account for my maintenance (4500kcal) meaning my total SURPLUS was 5500kcal. After that I need to account for the TEF so taking ~10%, 550kcals of the 5500kcal would be burned through digestion. So still in a 4950kcal surplus. Then NEAT, personally I respond well to overfeeding (as seen in my steps in the vid) so ill roughly assume an increase of ~200kcal burn/every excess 1000kcal based on Lavine’s estimations (990kcal). Still a 3960kcal surplus. Now composition of food, not all will be stored as fat because of carbs & protein but as seen in my macros I still ate 34% fat meaning 34% of that 3960kcal (1346kcal) would be available for PURE fat storage which = a FINAL storage of 150g or 0.3lb of fat in 1 day (of course some excess carbs may have been stored but likely not many\n",
      "➖\n",
      "So, just get back on track the next day as overall, 1 day of cheating, especially if active/lean & overfeeding carbs, isn’t a problem, it is if you do it 7x/wk but not if it’s a once off.\n",

      "This is a very common theme I see as a coach. People working really hard in the gym and trying to do everything right but not seeing any progress.⁣\n",
      "⁣\n",
      "Why is that? Most of the time it’s for 1 of 2 reasons (if not both).⁣\n",
      "⁣\n",
      "1.) Not being patient enough and having unrealistic expectations then giving up.⁣\n",
      "⁣\n",
      "2.) Not eating enough calories.⁣\n",
      "⁣\n",
      "We hear this term “lean bulk” being thrown around and honestly I think it’s on of the worst terms out there. The reason being is that it gets into people’s heads that no fat gain will come if you go really slow with your gaining phase.⁣\n",
      "⁣\n",
      "What this does is anytime someone starts seeing a little less of a six pack or the scale going up the immediately quit their gaining phase because of being scared of getting fat 🤦‍♂️⁣\n",
      "⁣\n",
      "All that is doing is ensuring you never will gain muscle.⁣\n",
      "⁣\n",
      "Do you have to get overweight or obese to put in muscle? Of course not and I would never suggest that, but what you do need to do is be ok and understand why putting on some body fat is necessary and beneficial for you when trying to gain muscle.⁣\n",
      "⁣\n",
      "Your body needs calories to grow. Calories are equivalent to the bricks needed to build a house. How can you build a house with materials? You can’t, so what makes you think you can build your body without food? ⁣\n",
      "⁣\n",
      "There is a strategic way to go about a gaining phase but strategic doesn’t mean zero body fat gain. If you aren’t willing to let go of your 6 pack for a while (and no I don’t mean 3 months) then you will never make significant changes to yourself body. I highly suggest people take at least 12 months for a building phase to have the chance of seeing noticeable changes in their physique when they diet down next time.⁣\n",
